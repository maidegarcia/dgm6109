/*
    Adjust the below-given SVG creation method to fit your project. In the example code, we have appended an SVG that is the same size as our svgWidth and svgHeight variables.

    We recommend drawing a thin black border around your whole SVG so that it's visually distinctive from the rest of your page, but if you have other ways of distinguishing it, feel free to remove ours!

    Below this, we have commented-out code that will create an SVG "group". You can use this code and then add all elements of your visualization to the group, if you prefer doing this to having to calculate using the margins everywhere.

    The dashed box that we added to the SVG group is useful as a "placeholder" for what should be the maximum area used by your visualization (if you use margins as we have, but that is also totally up to you!). However, we recommend making this box invisible in your final visualization so taht it doesn't clutter your axes and other visual elements.

    If you decide not to use parts of this code, be sure to delete it! Also, be sure to delete this and all other instructional code comments!

/**** function drawVisualization(data, viz) *****
 *  
 * This is just a reminder to write good function documentation that includes a description of what the function does, a list of each parameter's expected data type and purpose, and what the function returns (if anything). Be sure to review the lessons on function documentation as you work on this!
 * 
 * Our provided starting point for the function suggests processing your dataset as the first parameter and the SVG or group that you wish to draw to as your second parameter.
 * 
 * You can change these variables as needed. Just make sure that you explain what your code is doing. For example, it is a good idea to additionally list any global variables that your functions depend on.
